# Operators

An operator is a symbol that operates on a value or a variable. For example, `+` is an operator to perform addition between two numbers.

## Arithmetic Operators

An arithmetic operator performs mathematical operations such as addition, substraction, multiplication, division, etc on numerical values.

|Operator|Meaning of Operator|
|:---:|:---:|
|+|addition or unary plus|
|-|subtraction or unary minus|
|*|multiplication|
|/|division|
|%|remainder after division (modulo division)|

### Example

```C
// Working of arithmetic operators
#include <stdio.h>
int main()
{
    int a = 9,b = 4, c;

    c = a+b;
    printf("a+b = %d \n",c);
    c = a-b;
    printf("a-b = %d \n",c);
    c = a*b;
    printf("a*b = %d \n",c);
    c = a/b;
    printf("a/b = %d \n",c);
    c = a%b;
    printf("Remainder when a divided by b = %d \n",c);

    return 0;
}
```

Output of the program:

```
a+b = 13
a-b = 5
a*b = 36
a/b = 2
Remainder when a divided by b=1
```

The operators `+`, `-`, and `*` represent addition, substraction, and multiplication.

In normal calculation, `9/4 = 2.25`. However, the output is `2` in the program.  
It is because both the variables `a` and `b` are integers. Hence, the output is also an integer. The compiler drops the fractional part after `2` in `2.25`.

To make things clear: suppose `a = 5.0`, `b = 2.0`, `c = 5`, and `d = 2`. Then:
```
// Either one of the operands is a floating-point number
a/b = 2.5  
a/d = 2.5  
c/b = 2.5  

// Both operands are integers
c/d = 2
```

The modulo operator `%` computes the remainder. When `a=9` is divided by `b=4`, the remainder is `1`. The `%` operator can only be used with integers.

## Increment and Decrement Operators

The increment operator (`++`) increases the value of an operand (constant or variable) by 1. The decrement operator ('--') decreases the value of an operand by 1.

### Example

```C
// Working of increment and decrement operators
#include <stdio.h>
int main()
{
    int a = 10, b = 100;
    float c = 10.5, d = 100.5;

    printf("++a = %d \n", ++a);
    printf("--b = %d \n", --b);
    printf("++c = %f \n", ++c);
    printf("--d = %f \n", --d);

    return 0;
}
```

Output of the program:

```
++a = 11
--b = 99
++c = 11.500000
--d = 99.500000
```

### Prefix vs Postfix

In the above example we prefix variables by the increment or decrement operators. However, the operators can also be used as postfixes (after the operand).

- If you use the `++` operator as prefix like: `++var`. The value of `var` is incremented by 1 then, it returns the value.
- If you use the `++` operator as postfix like: `var++`. The original value of `var` is returned first then, `var` is incremented by 1.
- The `--` operator works in a similar way like the `++` operator except it decreases the value by 1.

## Assignment operators

An assignment operator is used for assigning a value to a variable. the most common assignment operator is `=`.

|Operator|Example|Same as|
|:---:|:---:|:---:|
|=|a = b|a = b|
|+=|a += b|a = a+b|
|-=|a -= b|a = a-b|
|*=|a *= b|a = a*b|
|/=|a /= b|a = a/b|
|%=|a %= b|a = a%b|

### Example

```C
// Working of assignment operators
#include <stdio.h>
int main()
{
    int a = 5, c;

    c = a;      // c is 5
    printf("c = %d\n", c);
    c += a;     // c is 10
    printf("c = %d\n", c);
    c -= a;     // c is 5
    printf("c = %d\n", c);
    c *= a;     // c is 25
    printf("c = %d\n", c);
    c /= a;     // c is 5
    printf("c = %d\n", c);
    c %= a;     // c = 0
    printf("c = %d\n", c);

    return 0;
}
```

Output of the program:

```
c = 5
c = 10
c = 5
c = 25
c = 5
c = 0
```

## Relational Operators

A relational operator checks the relationship between two operands. If the relation is true, it returns 1; if the relation is false, it returns value 0.

|Operator|Meaning of Operator|Example|
|:---:|:---:|:---:|
|==|Equal to|`5 == 3` is evaluated to 0|
|>|Greater than|`5 > 3` is evaluated to 1|
|<|Less than|`5 < 3` is evaluated to 0|
|!=|Not equal to|`5 != 3` is evaluated to 1|
|>=|Greater than or equal to|`5 >= 3` is evaluated to 1|
|<=|Less than or equal to|`5 <= 3` is evaluated to 0|

### Example

```C
// Working of relational operators
#include <stdio.h>
int main()
{
    int a = 5, b = 5, c = 10;

    printf("%d == %d is %d \n", a, b, a == b);
    printf("%d == %d is %d \n", a, c, a == c);
    printf("%d > %d is %d \n", a, b, a > b);
    printf("%d > %d is %d \n", a, c, a > c);
    printf("%d < %d is %d \n", a, b, a < b);
    printf("%d < %d is %d \n", a, c, a < c);
    printf("%d != %d is %d \n", a, b, a != b);
    printf("%d != %d is %d \n", a, c, a != c);
    printf("%d >= %d is %d \n", a, b, a >= b);
    printf("%d >= %d is %d \n", a, c, a >= c);
    printf("%d <= %d is %d \n", a, b, a <= b);
    printf("%d <= %d is %d \n", a, c, a <= c);

    return 0;
}
```

Output of the program:

```
5 == 5 is 1
5 == 10 is 0
5 > 5 is 0
5 > 10 is 0
5 < 5 is 0
5 < 10 is 1
5 != 5 is 0
5 != 10 is 1
5 >= 5 is 1
5 >= 10 is 0
5 <= 5 is 1
5 <= 10 is 1
```

## Logical Operators

An expression containing logical operator returns either 0 or 1 depending upon whether expression results true or false.

|Operator|Meaning|Example|
|:---:|:---:|:---:|
|&&|Logical AND. True only if all operands are true|If c = 5 and d = 2 then, expression ((c==5) && (d>5)) equals to 0.|
|\|\||Logical OR. True only if either one operand is true|If c = 5 and d = 2 then, expression ((c==5) || (d>5)) equals to 1.|
|!|Logical NOT. True only if the operand is 0|If c = 5 then, expression !(c==5) equals to 0.|

### Example

```C
// Working of logical operators

#include <stdio.h>
int main()
{
    int a = 5, b = 5, c = 10, result;

    result = (a == b) && (c > b);
    printf("(a == b) && (c > b) is %d \n", result);

    result = (a == b) && (c < b);
    printf("(a == b) && (c < b) is %d \n", result);

    result = (a == b) || (c < b);
    printf("(a == b) || (c < b) is %d \n", result);

    result = (a != b) || (c < b);
    printf("(a != b) || (c < b) is %d \n", result);

    result = !(a != b);
    printf("!(a != b) is %d \n", result);

    result = !(a == b);
    printf("!(a == b) is %d \n", result);

    return 0;
}
```

Output of the program:

```
(a == b) && (c > b) is 1
(a == b) && (c < b) is 0
(a == b) || (c < b) is 1
(a != b) || (c < b) is 0
!(a != b) is 1
!(a == b) is 0
```

**Explanation**  

- `(a == b) && (c > 5)` evaluates to 1 because both operands `(a == b)` and `(c > b)` is 1 (true).
- `(a == b) && (c < b)` evaluates to 0 because operand `(c < b)` is 0 (false).
- `(a == b) || (c < b)` evaluates to 1 because `(a = b)` is 1 (true).
- `(a != b) || (c < b)` evaluates to 0 because both operand `(a != b)` and `(c < b)` are 0 (false).
- `!(a != b)` evaluates to 1 because operand `(a != b)` is 0 (false). Hence, `!(a != b)` is 1 (true).
- `!(a == b)` evaluates to 0 because `(a == b)` is 1 (true). Hence, `!(a == b)` is 0 (false).

## Bitwise Operators

During computation, mathematical operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, etc are converted to bit-level which makes processing faster and saves power.

Bitwise operators are used in C to perform bit-level operations.

|Operators|Meaning of operators|
|:---:|:---:|
|&|Bitwise AND|
|\||Bitwise OR|
|^|Bitwise exclusive OR|
|~|Bitwise complement|
|<<|Shift left|
|>>|Shift right|

We will learn more on them later.

## Other operators

### Comma operator

Comma operators are used to link related expressions together. For example:

```C
int a, c = 5, 10;
```

### sizeof operator

The `sizeof` is a unary operator that returns the size of data (constants, variables, array, structure, etc).

**Example**  

```C
#include <stdio.h>
int main()
{
    int a;
    float b;
    double c;
    char d;
    printf("Size of int=%lu bytes\n",sizeof(a));
    printf("Size of float=%lu bytes\n",sizeof(b));
    printf("Size of double=%lu bytes\n",sizeof(c));
    printf("Size of char=%lu byte\n",sizeof(d));

    return 0;
}
```

Output of the program:

```
Size of int = 4 bytes
Size of float = 4 bytes
Size of double = 8 bytes
Size of char = 1 byte
```
